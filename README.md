C# implementation of Three.js

All the fun of Three.js, now using C#.

The library is far from being finished, with a handfull of fully working examples, still needs a lot of works.

### Usage ###

Download the library and open it in Visual Studio (the project includes both Library and Demos) and should run straight out of the box.
